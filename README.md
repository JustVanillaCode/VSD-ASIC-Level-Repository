This is a repository for ASIC Level of VLSI course.
Day 1 - Part 1 :
A chip is inside a cover also called a package. Rhere are many types of pakages, they are also avaliable in many materials like plastic. This package is mounted on a board like structure. One popular example of board is the aurdino board. The chip will have various components one of the important component are pads. It can be imagined as a path where signals can come in and out.Signals can be sent inside the chip and the signals can also come out of the chip. The 2 other main parts of hte chip are the die and the core. The logic lies solely in the core, logic like gates like and,or,not gates e.t.c, a core usually consists of the SoC, SRam, Adc, Dac, Pill, Spi and a couple of more components.Thepills, adcs, dac, Sram are the " Foundary IPs' " of a chip the chips, gadgets like Mobile Phones, Laptops and the performance of them all of these are dependent on the Ips'.Die is just simply the size of the chip. A foundary is bassically just a large extensive and colossal factory that helps in the manufacturing process. It fundamentally manufactures the ICs' (Integrated Circuits) or the chips. A IP stands for 'Intellucital Property ' that means it mandates a paticular intelligence to build the paticular block. A foundary plays a essential role in semiconducter industury. One of them is also present in IIT Bombay, India.

Usually, chips are coded in C or C++ languages  as they are more suatiable for this process. This code is passed into a compiler and is converted into binary as it is the
only language a computer understands. Let us take an example  of  a  RISC-V, hte code is first colmpiled into it's assembly language program which is nothing but the RISC-V
program,then this assembly language program is converted into machine language(Binary) which  is understood  by  the  computer. This is then executed to get the output. The
flow is -  Architecture --> RTL --> Layout(qFlow)  

There are many apps or application software that we use on a daily basis. They all depend on the chip. The central focus of our consideration hinges on that how does it happen? The apps execute a signal to the so called "System Software" in turn converts the program to binary language. Majorly, the system software consists of the OS(Operating System), Compiler and the Assembler. It handles the IO operations, Allocates memory and also hepps in low-level system functions. A compiler and assembler convert the progtam to the chip type program for example ikf it is a RISC - V chip, the program will be converted into a RISC - V instrocution. The
