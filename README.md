# VSD-ASIC-Level-Repository
This is a repository for ASIC Level of VLSI course.
Day 1 - Part 1 :
A chip is inside a cover also called a package. Rhere are many types of pakages, they are also avaliable in many materials like plastic. This package is mounted on a board like structure. One popular example of board is the aurdino board. The chip will have various components one of the important component are pads. It can be imagined as a path where signals can come in and out.Signals can be sent inside the chip and the signals can also come out of the chip. The 2 other main parts of hte chip are the die and the core. The logic lies solely in the core, logic like gates like and,or,not gates e.t.c, a core usually consists of the SoC, SRam, Adc, Dac, Pill, Spi and a couple of more components.The pills, adcs, dac, Sram are the " Foundary IPs' " of a chip the chips, gadgets like Mobile Phones, Laptops and the performance of them all of these are dependent on the Ips'. Die is just simply the size of the chip. A foundary is bassically just a large extensive and colossal factory that helps in the manufacturing process. It fundamentally manufactures the ICs' (Integrated Circuits) or the chips. A IP stands for 'Intellucital Property ' that means it mandates a paticular intelligence to build the paticular block. A foundary plays a essential role in semiconducter industury. One of them is also present in IIT Bombay, India.

Usually, chips are coded in C or C++ languages  as they are more suatiable for this process
