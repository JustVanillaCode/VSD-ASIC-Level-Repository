# VSD-ASIC-Level-Repository
This is a repository for the ASIC Level of VLSI course.
Day 1 - Part 1 :
A chip is inside a cover also called a package. There are many types of packages, they are also available in many materials like plastic. This package is mounted on a board-like structure. One popular example of a board is the Arduino board. The chip will have various components one of the important components are pads. It can be imagined as a path where signals can come in and out. Signals can be sent inside the chip and the signals can also come out of the chip. The 2 other main parts of the chip are the die and the core. The logic lies solely in the core, logic like gates like and, or, not gates e.t.c, a core usually consists of the SoC, SRam, Adc, Dac, Pill, Spi and a couple of more components. The pills, ADCS, DAC, and Sram are the "Foundry IPs' " of a chip, gadgets like Mobile Phones, laptops, and their performance of them all of these are dependent on the IPs'.Die is just simply the size of the chip. A foundry is a large extensive and colossal factory that helps in the manufacturing process. It fundamentally manufactures the ICs' (Integrated Circuits) or the chips. An IP stands for 'Intellectual Property ' which means it mandates a particular intelligence to build the particular block. A foundry plays an essential role in the semiconductor industry. One of them is also present in IIT Bombay, India.

Usually, chips are coded in C or C++ languages  as they are more suitable for this process. This code is passed into a compiler and is converted into binary as it is the
only language a computer understands. Let us take an example  of  a  RISC-V, the code is first compiled into it's assembly language program which is nothing but the RISC-V
program, then this assembly language program is converted into machine language(Binary) which  is understood  by  the  computer. This is then executed to get the output. The
flow is -  Architecture --> RTL --> Layout(qFlow)  

There are many apps or application software that we use on a daily basis. They all depend on the chip. The central focus of our consideration hinges on that how does it happen? The apps execute a signal to the so-called "System Software" which in turn converts the program to binary language. Majorly, the system software consists of the OS(Operating System), Compiler, and Assembler. It handles the IO operations, Allocates memory, and also helps in low-level system functions. A compiler and assembler convert the program to the chip type program for example if it is a RISC - V chip, the program will be converted into a RISC - V instruction. The abstract interface instruction set architecture can also be called the 'architecture of a computer '.
